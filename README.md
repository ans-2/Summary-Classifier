# Summary-Classifier

GenreTranslate is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool designed to analyze and classify the genre of text summaries from various sources. By processing summaries from a wide array of content (articles, books, research papers, and more), GenreTranslate automatically identifies the genre of the text, whether it's fiction, non-fiction, science, history, or any other predefined category.

Additionally, GenreTranslate goes beyond genre classification by providing three high-quality translations of each summary, allowing users to explore content in different languages while preserving its core meaning. This combination of genre identification and multilingual translation makes GenreTranslate an invaluable tool for researchers, content creators, and language enthusiasts seeking to understand and explore summaries from diverse fields in multiple languages.
